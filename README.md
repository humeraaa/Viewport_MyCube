# Lab Objectives: Viewport_MyCube
(a) To understand sequence of events in graphics program via code organization  
(b) To set multiple viewports                                               
(c) To set perspective and orthographics camera and attach them to view port                                             
(d) To use built-in camera orbit controls for 3D viewing                                   
(e) To use built-in GridHelper to identify world space origin                            
(f) To use customize hardcoded 2D geometry by drawing simple house and triangle in Experiment1.js and Experiment2.js                                 
(g) To use built-in Box-Helper feature to demonstrate bounding box aroung triangle in Experiment2.js                                          
(h) To bind Image as simple texture with avialable/built-in plane-geometry                                      
(i) To add and remove child objects from scene graph                                                              
(j) To use built-in cube geometry and display wireframe cube (enable return wire-fram in myCube.js)                                  
(h) To understand customize cube drawing using vertex list, faces and face index list                         
(e) Students task is to experimenting with cube and setting camera for appropriate understanding of Mesh and Camera
